        <h1>Tips for Financial Cybersecurity</h1>
        <h2>Tip 1: Click and Browse with Caution</h2>
        <p>
            Not clicking on a link that may look fishy is the best way to avoid getting hit with a malicious attack. If the link looks like a safe link, make sure to verify
            through clarifying with the company, organization etc. This also applies to the downloading of content on the web on a suspicious website. Doing these things
            may leave you vulnerable to a cybersecurity risk.
        </p>
        <h2>Tip 2: Create a strong password and enable two factor authentication (2FA)</h2>
        <p>
            Create a strong password that wouldn't be easily guessable by attackers. On top of that, don't use the same password on multiple websites. If an attacker has
            access to a password that you used for multiple website, now they have access to those websites. Alongside a strong and unique password, set up two factor
            authentication (2FA). 2FA adds another layer of security on top of a normal password by adding different means of verifying your identity through fingerprint,
            text messenger, authentication app, etc. While also having these extra layers of security, don't give out your password to other people or companies, either through
            text messages, emails, and or suspicious website. Verify that the recipient is trusted. Most companies aren't going to be asking for information from you in emails,,
            suspicious links, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Tip 3: Update and Maintain your software</h2>
        <p>
            Whenever a new software update comes for a software you're using, update it immediately. Be sure to also update to the latest software instead of sticking with older
            updates. These updates may fix critical bugs that might let attackers get to your information.
        </p>
        <h2>Tip 4: Only use the hardware you have</h2>
        <p>
            When using others people hardware, they may have software that can grab any password that you type while using it. Be sure to avoid using public computers and
            delete history, cache, and log out of accounts after you're using one if you must.
        </p>
        <h2>Tip 5: Back Up Files</h2>
        <p>In case of an attack, having important backups to those files may help stop valuable information from disappearing entirely. One way
            is to have a physical backup in the form of a hard drive or a digital one in the cloud.
